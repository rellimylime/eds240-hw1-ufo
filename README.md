# EDS 240 Homework 1: Interpreting ggplot2 Code

## Purpose

This repository contains my work for EDS 240 Homework 1, where I interpret and analyze data wrangling and visualization code adapted from Dan Oehm's UFO Sightings TidyTuesday submission. The assignment focuses on building code literacy by examining someone else's ggplot2 implementation.
